        <h2>1.1</h2>
        <p>
            I decided to go with a simple and easy to use interface starting with the navbar along the top of the page, an animated logo just under the navbar and content is displayed central to the screen making the website accessible and viewable from any platform. Everything has a rounded feel with bright colours that pop and catch the eye.

        <h2>1.5</h2>
        <p>
            Copyright is a law put in place to stop people from stealing and using other peoples intellectual properties you can however use another persons property for commentary or review purposes.

        <h2>1.6</h2>
        <p>
            When creating a website colour blindness should be taken to mind making sure text and background colours are clearly defined and non-obtrusive helping someone who might be colour blind to read all text you should also make sure your text is resizable so it makes it easier to read for people who have difficulty reading smaller text. 
        </p>
        <h2>1.7</h2>
        <p>
            If uploading pictures, audio or video to your website you should make sure you are using a compatible file type such png, jpeg, gif or svg for pictures, or mp4, avi, mpg and ogg for videos, Then for audio you have wav, mp3, aac and many more for all types of media.
