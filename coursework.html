        <h2>Outcome 1</h2>
        <h3><big>1.1</big></h3>
        <p>
            In this modern time technology surrounds 
            almost every aspect of our lives making 
            everything we do more efficient and making 
            any information we need easier to find than 
            ever before. Technology is vital for businesses 
            to keep in contact all the over the globe while 
            also helping companies combat security threats.
        </p>
        <h3><big>1.2</big></h3>
        <p>
            There are a variety of methods you can use 
            while creating a digital project some of 
            the main methods being Waterfall, Kanban and
            Scrum. When creating any digital project, it
            is important to have strong communication
            with your team and to also be able to solve
            problems efficiently when they arise. To
            start creating a digital project you will
            need some tools to help you and your team,
            First youâ€™ll need to decide what software and
            coding program you will use to start building
            your creation, you will then need a way for 
            you and your team to stay coordinated and for 
            that you would use something like slack and or 
            Trello, slack for helping keep ideas and 
            conversation clean and easy to work from and 
            Trello for tasks organised from to do, doing and done tabs. 
        </p>
        <h3><big>1.3</big></h3>
        <p>
            I will plan my website using trello to keep all of my ideas organized, to keep track of what I am currently doing and what I have done.

        <h3><big>1.4</big></h3>
        <p>
            When creating any kind of digital project there can be many different variables that can interrupt or make a project fail, some of the main things that can cause things to go wrong are not having enough resources for the planned project or poor planning but there can also be unexpected complications such as software that you are developing for becoming outdated or a major member of the team leaving to work on a different project. 
        </p>
        <h3><big>1.5</big></h3>
        <p>
            To choose the right tools and languages for your project you need to consider what you are pushing to achieve. If your project is a website then you would choose html, css and or java depending on what functionality you want the site have. If your project was to make a game you would need to decide what platform/s you were developing for before you choose which languages are necessary. 
        </p>
        <h3><big>1.6</big></h3>
        <p>
            Trello has been a useful tool acting as a digital white board helping me plan the design, features and track tasks. Github is almost essential when developing any kind of software making an online backup of all of your files and collaborators have access whenever they need. 
        </p>
        <h3><big>1.7</big></h3>
        <p>
            If your project involves users information then you would need to be aware of General Data Protection Regulation(GDPR) it requires users personal information and sensitive data to be encrypted and all access to the persons data should be logged. Companies are also required to provide clear consent forms to opt in for tracking and personal advertising.

        <h2>Outcome 2</h2>
        <h3><big>2.1</big></h3>
        <p>
            I feel that using visual studio code is helpful when working with multiple scripts/languages keeping different pages tabbed and organized and also helps with auto bracket-matching, auto-indentation and many keyboard shortcuts. Trello is useful for keeping plans organised and massively helpful for keeping a team in sync.
        </p>
        <h3><big>2.2</big></h3>
        <p>
            Visual studio code was appropriate for the current project as it is compatible with many different coding languages, easy to use and works on most platforms. Trello was appropriate as it helps logs ideas implemented and changes to your project. 
        </p>
        <h3><big>2.3</big></h3>
        <p>
            Overall I feel my website is uniform and everything feels co-ordinated, though some of my pages feel saturated with content and could be split into multiple pages.Ultimately I felt that I achieved with what I had planned my website to be. 
        </p>
        <h3><big>2.4</big></h3>
        <p>
            Continuing the website I would make the navbar animated while keeping the ui as user friendly as possible. I would also re-plan the layout of content as to not oversaturate pages,  such as creating an about me page and move the content from home page to the new about me page.
        </p>
        <h3><big>2.5</big></h3>
        <p>
            When creating my website project I have set myself tasks in order to ensure I accomplish my goals via <a id="button" href="https://trello.com/b/OZ4vFLKW/maxs-website" target="_blank">Trello</a>.<br>  I have broken down my tasks accordingly to make sure that when I apply the HTML and CSS in VS Code, they match those requirements and therefore the criteria. Once creating the code for my content I will be analysing my website on its frequently made changes to see if the requirements have been fulfilled, such as all the links taking us to the correct pages, images and content is aligned to the aesthetics of my personal choice, etc. The process from there will be to move onto the next task and repeat this method to check if all of my content is 'fit for purpose'.

        <h2>Outcome 3</h2>
        <h3><big>3.1</big></h3>
        <p>
            In making my website I found myself to be incredibly productive making it an enjoyable and slightly challenge for myself but If making a website as a team it tools have made it easy to keep in contact and up to date with teams progress but with the rapid growth of social networking, gaming apps and other features available to us so easily it makes procrastination also easier than ever before which also affects our attention spans making learning something new harder. 
        </p>
        <h3><big>3.2</big></h3>
        <p>
            To keep yourself and or your team productive and efficient you need to make sure your plan is clear and understood while also keeping motivated by being excited about the product you and your team are producing. You should also make sure to take regular breaks as to avoid burning out and keep your mind clear. 
        </p>
        <h3><big>3.3</big></h3>
        <p>
            To make my next project efficient depending on the scope I would consider using a team with also the use of trello to keep all of our ideas organised and to outline what specific people should be working on, I would also use slack to keep everyone in contact and to share work and information. 
        </p>
        <h3><big>3.4</big></h3>
        <p>
            To test a digital project I would thoroughly look through my code checking for any abnormalities and consistently checking the outcome of your code can help keep your code organized making it easier to the discover the problem when it arises. You can also get a colleague to check through your code as they may notice something you might have missed.
